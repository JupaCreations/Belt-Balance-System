# D-workx 234
CoreXY 3D printer 200-300-400 XYZ build volume

Work in progress! 99.9% is ready. Parts are ready and approoved for printing.
Instruction manual is more work as expected and time issues are a common thing.
I let you know when ALL is finished.

How it works.....and the facts

Different in certain areas where both other designs were not up to my way of tinkering. Knowledge learned along the way and now put into this project. Enjoy the same way as I did during the prototype phase. 
Outside dimensions 540 x 540 x 540 mm.
Buildplate dimensions XY 400 x 400 mm maximum.
Currently used heatbed 328 x 328 mm Z height maximum 385 mm (540 mm cube with E3D V6) 
Sides can be easily enclosed for airdraft reduction for those who want to print filaments that need it. In a later stage the printer can be enclosed fully for heatchamber printing. All parts gathered by shopping all around the world. 

D-workx CORE XYZ 234 is based on the proven CORE XYZ concept. This means the printhead is moving in XY directions but the printbed does not move (stationary) in horizontal positions like I3 based cartesian printers. Due to the reduced XY mass movement, less ringing, resonation and artefacts are the result at higher print speeds if needed.

The D-workx XYZ 234 is a very simple to build DIY concept not using special parts or tools and in my opinion clever way when it comes to the use of some technical details like the Z-belt bed lifting in all four corners of the printer. No leadscrews, linear rails or rods are used which enhanced the noise reduction witout compromising print quality. 
Gathering in my personal opinion the best solutions to get a silent and stable as possible printer with high print quality at a reasonable DIY price level. Also easy for regular maintenance or troubleshooting. 
 
234 in the D-workx CORE XYZ 234 name is the reference to a 200, 300 and 400 mm print volume area in the XY directions. So we are not talking about a fixed design but highly adaptable to your own needs. With the standard 500 x 500 x 500 mm V-slot profiles and 20 mm corner cubes a maximum 400 x 400 mm horizontal print area can be achieved. 

If you reduce all horizontal V-slot profiles with 100 mm base length you get the next step maximum print volume area in X and Y direction. 
500 mm V-slot profiles > maximum 400 mm horizontal print area.
400 mm V-slot profiles > maximum 300 mm horizontal print area.
300 mm V-slot profiles > maximum 200 mm horizontal print area. 
The X-carriage will always reduce the XY print size with 100mm from any chosen length. 
The maximum height of Z is 385 mm. But it is up to your choice if you make the maximum Z build size lower or higher. So you can make a 200 x 200 x 385 mm or 400 x 400 x 200 mm print volume. We also try to reduce the weight of the printhead unit by using a short bowden setup. We have not tried higher volumes as we do think they are not needed for 99% of the 3D printers in use. 

The difference............4 corner lifting. The Z system is a 4 corner lifting system. It is based on a coupled dual (left, right, front and rear) belt/idler drive system (closed loop with push/pull) with two separate stepper motors and 1:40 brass worm gear reductions. This system ensures a smooth up and down step with 1.8 degree stepper motors even with smaller NEMA 17 stepper motors as the load is divided over two motors. 

Worm gears also prevent the bed to go down on its own weigth when the Z steppers are de-energized. 
As the Z belt system is directly located in the 4 corners of the profile cube there is no fear of the profiles being bent/distorted under Z belt pressure. Also the belts are not in the way when access to the build plate is needed from the front. 

6 mm GT2 belts are used and sufficient for a maximum build size of 500 x 500 x 500 mm. XY and Z belts tension can be adjusted independed and easily with a hex screw driver. 


 
For those who want to print (enclosed and draft free) for example ABS, the printer is designed with a flush profile outside. All parts are inside the vertical V-slot profile cube sides. This means covering panels like wood, foam, polycarbonate, plexiglass or even cheap cardboard can be attached in rectangled sizes without the need of any post cut outs.
